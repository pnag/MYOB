====================================================
SOLUTION
===================================================
1/ The solution consists of 
   myob_tax_calc.rb
	Ruby script for MYOB Employee tax computation
   myob_emp.csv
	input CSV file contains Employee information
   myob_salary_slip.csv
	output file generated by the script for pay slips
   tax_slab.csv
	This is the tax slab details, if the tax slab is changed in the next year, the new file can be provided as input without altering the tax computation logic.
   README.txt
	README file contains the solution details, notes and assumptions

2/ The script requires 3 input parameters as below
   1.myob_emp.csv # input file
   2.myob_salary_slip.csv # output file
   3.tax_slab.csv # Tax Slab config file

3/ the script is executed as below
	ruby myob_tax_calc.rb myob_emp.csv myob_salary_slip.csv tax_slab.csv

4/ Ruby version in my mac
	ruby 2.1.4p265 (2014-10-27 revision 48166) [x86_64-darwin13.0]

====================================================
NOTES
====================================================
1/ field names are "_" separated
2/ there is no space in the input file(s) after ","
3/ salary range was taken as salary month
4/ Input parameter validations are not done
5/ field level validations are not done
6/ output file field names are changed


=====================================================
ASSUMPTONS
=====================================================
1/ Ruby is installed in the target machine to execute
2/ Always the input files are provided as input
3/ Change in the field names in input/output will not impact the solution
